            <p class="mb-0">GoDaddy offers a wide range of plans designed to support every user, from first-time bloggers to major enterprises. The 3 central plans, however, cater to beginners, regular bloggers, and SMBs respectively. All plans come with a free domain for a year, and unlimited bandwidth. And if you already have a domain name purchased from a different registrar, GoDaddy domain transfers are easy to initiate and confirm.</p>

            <h6 class="mb-2">Bronze</h6>
            <p class="mb-3">This is GoDaddy's most basic package, suitable for first-timers who are just dipping their toes into digital waters. Especially good for bloggers and individuals looking to set up a personal site, this option is much more limited than the other plans, offering 10GB of website space, 5 email accounts, and 50MB of email storage per email account. GoDaddy email setup is a breeze, and if you want to run additional Web-based services with GoDaddy, the Google Apps integration can open up a new world of possibilities. While the other plans entitle you to $200 worth of free ad credits, however, this option comes with just $50 and no serious security features.</p>
            <h6 class="mb-2">Gold</h6>
            <p class="mb-3">When you're ready for a bit of an upgrade, GoDaddy’s most popular plan—Plus—is a good step up. Featuring $200 in free marketing offers, unlimited email accounts, unmetered space and storage, unlimited parked- and sub-domains—this is a fully-rounded package suitable for small businesses and organizations with moderate needs. With Global CDN and SpamExpert included, this is a strong plan with plenty of room for users to grow an impressive, and active, online presence.</p>
            <h6 class="mb-2">Platinum</h6>
            <p class="mb-0">If your goals are a little more ambitious, an extra $10 will give you access to Business Pro. Virtually unlimited in every respect and bundled with an SSL certificate, SiteBackup Pro, a dedicated IP address, and domain privacy, this is a package for business owners ready for some serious online growth.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-2">Technology</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">There's a lot of technology under the hood at GoDaddy (take note: this provider uses a Linux operating system) – and plenty of expertise to back it up. Virtual private server (VPS) hosting gives businesses their own operating system, controls, and flexibility. Dedicated hosting allows for a huge amount of power and space. Both GoDaddy hosting types are readily available with a range of high-performance options.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-2">Cloud Hosting</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">As one of the most versatile and dynamic types of hosting options on the market, cloud hosting is very popular among new business owners. And with GoDaddy, cloud hosting is provided through a partnership with CloudFlare, a company that delivers content via a network of servers that adjust to handle the ebbs and flows of your website’s traffic. Cloud hosting is more affordable than dedicated options, and in some cases can provide increased uptime. Webmasters on these types of servers, however, also have less control over the specific hardware and software that powers their site, meaning that cloud hosting might not be the best option for everyone.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-2">Email</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">Email is easy to use when you choose this host, because of the company’s versatile options and intuitive inbox interface. For users who need to check their email from wherever they are, GoDaddy webmail is accessible from any device with an Internet connection. It’s as easy as just heading to the GoDaddy login webmail and entering your username and password. But if you’d prefer to use an email client like Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird, GoDaddy IMAP settings make it simple to keep your messages in sync. Likewise, if you have another inbox that you regularly check, GoDaddy email forwarding can be set up to direct all of your incoming messages to the email service of your choice.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-2">Conclusion</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">With good customer support, a blissfully simple cPanel, a great range of options to suit users of all stripes, and very cost-competitive options, GoDaddy is a really strong competitor in the field of Web hosting and a great choice for most users. Downtime and page-load speeds are not always what they could be, but with flexible options and good feedback, it's easy to overlook this infrequent glitch if your site doesn't need to be super-fast. If you're looking for a good all-around host, GoDaddy is a great option and offers a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not happy. So why not give it a go?.</p>
